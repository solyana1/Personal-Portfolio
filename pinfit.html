            <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
            <p>PinFit is a location-based fitness application that allows users to connect for a team workout session.
              It aims to combine goal-setting with accountability partnership to promote active lifestyle among
              millennials. With sedentary lifestyle causing numerous health risks, finding the right workout buddy could
              be the answer to helping one get fit and stay active. </p>

        <div id="problem">
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Millions of Americans set the goal of exercising to enhance their health every year. However, they don’t
            achieve them due to lack of motivation and accountability. </p>
          <img src="images/fail.png" class="fail" alt="security">

        <div id="solutions">
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>To help individuals stay committed to their fitness plans, I designed a mobile app that allows users to
            find compatible workout partners in their locations of choice based on their goals and physical activity
            interests.</p>

        <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
        <h5>User Survey</h5>
        <p>I conducted two surveys to gauge whether people would be interested in social fitness and what features my
          target market would want in a new fitness app. The result was as follows: </p>
      </div>
      <div id="results">
        <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="survey-results" id="result1">
            <h6 style="color:#0055A9">90%</h6>
            <p> of individuals who like to exercise with others do so because they believe working out with others is
              <strong>motivating </strong> and <strong>enjoyable</strong>. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="survey-results" id="result2">
            <h6 style="color:#7B178B;">66%</h6>
            <p> of participants who rarely workout said that they have not stuck with a fitness routine due to <strong>
                lack of motivation </strong></p>

        </div>

            <h6 style="color:#007E14;">80%</h6>
            <p> of those who often exercise with other people mentioned that they do so with <strong> same people
              </strong>. </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Armed with this data, I looked for ways to best meet my users needs by creating an application with unique
            features in the saturated market of health and fitness apps. </p>

          <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
          <p>Although there are countless workout trackers and health monitoring apps, there aren’t many geared towards
            helping partner individuals for a workout. Some of the few I found were as follows.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>

              </div>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>After conducting research I saw opportunities to stand out from the competition by incorporating some of
            the important features that these fitness apps were lacking such as a rating system one could utilize to
            determine a partner's personality and overall compatibility.</p>

            enough information that will allow PinFit to present to them potential workout partners. Although the
            functionality seemed self-explanatory to testers, some suggested I turn the typical form-like registration
            into a more engaging questionaire to keep users interested enough to accurately complete their information.

          allow one to choose location (“pin”) and find a fitness (“fit”) partner. </p>

          <h5> Mockups and Prototypes</h5>
          <p>With a brand guideline and an updated wireframe, I crafted mockups in Figma. I then used these mockups to
            further validate my ideas and assumptions making sure all the pieces I had crafted translated into a
            coherent and meaningful prototype.</p>

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>I conducted both in-person and virtual tests to observe and analyze how my testers interacted with the
          prototypes. This uncovered several flaws that I would have missed had I not set out to validate my notions at
          this stage of the design process. For instance, I made the questionnaire more gender-inclusive by adding an
          “other” option and incorporated the most appropriate input control by using a checkbox instead of toggle
          switch. </p>

        <p>Additionally, numerous testers clicked on the calendar multiple times before identifying the plus floating
          action button to add their availabilities. Realizing that the FAB was not serving its intented purpose, I
          decided to change it into a prominent button with text “+ availability” and placed it closer to the calendar.
          Surely, when I ran another test, 99% of testers accurately identified the new button. There was also positive
          feedback on the screen overall as the headings gave the calendar better context.</p>

        <h5>Preference Testing</h5>
        <p>Before wrapping up my mockup designs and rolling out my final prototype, I preference tested a few key areas
          of this product. The one area I tested that led to change was the 'Discover' screen. </p>

        <img src="images/pf-ab.png" alt="A/B testing">
        <p>92% percent mentioned they prefer seeing key words and phrases instead of paragraphs. Some stated they would
          go to their profile page for further details and thus “empty words” were unnecessary on this screen.
          Therefore, I replaced paragraphs with key words and phrases.</p>

        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p>As rewarding as working on PinFit was, creating this niche product had its challenges. From conducting
          multiple surveys to figure out what target users want to implementing the right features for an MVP was not an
          easy feat. However, with frequent user testing throughout the design process, I was able to validate one idea
          after another until users could effortlessly complete tasks on the prototype. In addition, I was fighting the
          urge to design additional features like finding the closest gym, especially when testers had opinions about
          extra features I should include . Regardless, I stayed consistent with my user stories and personas to make
          sure scope creep did not occur. Overall, this project was a success as an app with a unique spin to motivating
          individuals stay active.</p>
